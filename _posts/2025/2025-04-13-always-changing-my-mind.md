The closer I get to launching my game, and of a few plans coming together, the more the future plans wiggle around. I feel like I should make a point of saying, to myself as much as anyone reading this, that anything I say is "in the works" is definitely subject to change.

In the last few weeks I have altered quite a few things. I'm changing the name of Hyperspace Frontier to Exo: Frontier. Partly this is because I realised the name is far too similar to another miniatures game called Hypersteel Nightmare. I wasn't aware of it til recently but it looks cool so I thought it best not to go so similar with the name. There's also Hyperlight Drifter, a fairly well known computer game - so I picked something else. Also the next kit is well underway, I **really** enjoy working on ramshackle looking stuff.

The other reason for the name change is, while I want to make lots of different game using my Momentum system, I think it would be cool to make multiple games within the same settings. I love world building and that would be a really fun way to do it. So in this case my not-so-serious sci-fi setting is being called Exo and I'm keeping the name Frontier (or possibly Frontiers) - so it's Exo: Frontier. I'm excited by this as it seems to drive my creativity, thinking about what other kinds of games would exist within this setting and other concepts to explore. I have something else I'm really interested in from this setting that I'm excited to show soon.

## Momentum

While I'm talking about my Momentum system, I have been working on the style I want for the rulebook, even though it will often be read in rules for other games. I had this idea of it being like an instruction manual design, and then I remembered how much I love those exploded diagrams from Haynes manuals. I did a sketch of what I'm thinking and have started working on a CAD file so that I can do it properly. I think this would be a great style for all the diagrams in the book, though I am always partial to the hand drawn look too.

## Patreon, Online Stores, Kickstarters, Oh My!

I've also wavered back and forth on how to present my work, I am inherently uncomfortable with marketing and promotion as it tends to clash with my desire to make what I love. I think I've settled on Patreon first, STLs for purchase second, and offering physical prints as well. Patreon seems like a way to connect to people interested in what I'm doing so that's a huge appeal, trying to set up a big Kickstarter or build a huge social presence is just not my skill set. Having a store is an obvious second, though tackling physical prints comes with some challenges, shipping internationally and keeping up with any demand. In all likelihood I will end up partnering with someone to do fulfillment on miniatures if it grows.

I do worry about running a Patreon, about keeping up the pace and not disappointing people, about exactly what this post is about - my constantly changing mind. To avoid this kind of uncertainty in what will be releasing I'm planning to work from having a lead on releases. Making sure I'm several months ahead will mean I can be clearer about what's coming and also make sure there's a consistent release schedule no matter what life throws up. It's a lot more work up front but I think it's worth it, something like that wont take off overnight anyway (if at all).

So enough rambling. I have some sculpting to get back to.
