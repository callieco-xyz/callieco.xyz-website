      <h1>A new blog</h1>
      <p>I made myself a new blog! I wanted somewhere I could share longer form content about some things, mostly around tabletop games, making miniatures, painting, that kind of thing. The more things change online the more I believe in creating the small internet, in removing myself as much as possible from large centralised sites that often don’t have my best interests at heart. This is mostly a personal thing and not a judgement on anyone else’s choices.</p>

<p>Because I want to make stuff, and promote the stuff I make, I can’t avoid it entirely and have joined Bluesky and have been on Mastodon for a few years now. Currently Bluesky is just under my Renegade Minis brand which is where I make miniatures and games and such. That’s @renegademinis@bsky.social if you don’t already follow me. And if you prefer a more personal touch you can find me @pidgeon_pete@mas.to (a TMNT reference if you need an explanation for the handle).</p>

<p>Anyway, this is the post I assume no one will read but you have to kick it off somewhere. A follow up about the actual things this blog is about will follow…</p>

<p>Until then don’t go empty handed, here’s a page from my sketchbook full of some… folks.</p>
