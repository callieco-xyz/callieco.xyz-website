        <h3><a href="/miniature%20painting/2025/03/23/high-contrast.html">High Contrast</a></h3>
        <p>I recently finished painting a new miniature for my collection, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. The process began with a solid black primer to ensure the details would pop once I started layering on colors. I decided to go for a bold, high-contrast color scheme with a mix of metallic silvers and deep blues for the armor, which gave the miniature a striking look. I used washes to bring out the details and a light dry brushing technique to highlight the raised areas, making the figure feel dynamic and well-defined.</p>
