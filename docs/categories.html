        <h2><a href="/personal%20stuff/2025/03/23/a-new-blog.html">A new blog</a></h2>
        <p>I made myself a new blog! I wanted somewhere I could share longer form content about some things, mostly around tabletop games, making miniatures, painting, that kind of thing. The more things change online the more I believe in creating the small internet, in removing myself as much as possible from large centralised sites that often don’t have my best interests at heart. This is mostly a personal thing and not a judgement on anyone else’s choices.</p>

<p>Because I want to make stuff, and promote the stuff I make, I can’t avoid it entirely and have joined Bluesky and have been on Mastodon for a few years now. Currently Bluesky is just under my Renegade Minis brand which is where I make miniatures and games and such. That’s @renegademinis@bsky.social if you don’t already follow me. And if you prefer a more personal touch you can find me @pidgeon_pete@mas.to (a TMNT reference if you need an explanation for the handle).</p>

        <h2><a href="/my%20games/2025/03/25/hyperspace-frontier-march-update.html">Hyperspace Frontier March '25 update</a></h2>
        <p>Since the blog is new I guess the only place I will have shared anything about my upcoming game is on social media, and that basically means hardly at all. I really don’t post often enough and word limits make it hard to explain much. So in brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m making a tabletop miniature game including miniatures, rules, art etc.</li>
  <li>The kits I’m making are all modular and are broadly compatible with other kits.</li>
  <li>It’s a sci-fi mash up all sorts of themes but players can make of it what they want.</li>
</ul>

<p>So where am I up to?</p>
