  <h2><a href="/renegade%20minis%20games/2025/04/28/april-game-update.html">April Game Update</a></h2>
  <p>Notice this post is not called “Hyperspace Frontier update”… I realised the name is too similar to some other games out there. Namely Hyperlight Drifter and a miniatures game I just discovered called Hypersteel Nightmare (that looks really fun). I could stick with it but I am stopping to take stock and figure out where I am going, and that also means changing the name.</p>

<p>I have been a little overwhelmed this month, I have been working on a commission which has been amazing, but I can’t share any details of it yet. It’s a very exciting model and I have loved working on it but it has taken up a lot more of my mental energy and time than I expected. I have been far from idle though. I thought about holding these renders back until I was ready to start building some “hype” for the game but I think it’s ok on here:</p>

  <h2><a href="/personal%20stuff/2025/04/13/always-changing-my-mind.html">Always Changing My Mind</a></h2>
  <p>The closer I get to launching my game, and of a few plans coming together, the more the future plans wiggle around. I feel like I should make a point of saying, to myself as much as anyone reading this, that anything I say is “in the works” is definitely subject to change.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks I have altered quite a few things. I’m changing the name of Hyperspace Frontier to Exo: Frontier. Partly this is because I realised the name is far too similar to another miniatures game called Hypersteel Nightmare. I wasn’t aware of it til recently but it looks cool so I thought it best not to go so similar with the name. There’s also Hyperlight Drifter, a fairly well known computer game - so I picked something else. Also the next kit is well underway, I <strong>really</strong> enjoy working on ramshackle looking stuff.</p>

  <h2><a href="/renegade%20minis%20games/2025/03/25/hyperspace-frontier-march-update.html">Hyperspace Frontier March '25 update</a></h2>
  <p>Since the blog is new I guess the only place I will have shared anything about my upcoming game is on social media, and that basically means hardly at all. I really don’t post often enough and word limits make it hard to explain much. So in brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m making a tabletop miniature game including miniatures, rules, art etc.</li>
  <li>The kits I’m making are all modular and are broadly compatible with other kits.</li>
  <li>It’s a sci-fi mash up all sorts of themes but players can make of it what they want.</li>
</ul>

<p>So where am I up to?</p>

  <h2><a href="/personal%20stuff/2025/03/23/a-new-blog.html">A new blog</a></h2>
  <p>I made myself a new blog! I wanted somewhere I could share longer form content about some things, mostly around tabletop games, making miniatures, painting, that kind of thing. The more things change online the more I believe in creating the small internet, in removing myself as much as possible from large centralised sites that often don’t have my best interests at heart. This is mostly a personal thing and not a judgement on anyone else’s choices.</p>

<p>Because I want to make stuff, and promote the stuff I make, I can’t avoid it entirely and have joined Bluesky and have been on Mastodon for a few years now. Currently Bluesky is just under my Renegade Minis brand which is where I make miniatures and games and such. That’s @renegademinis@bsky.social if you don’t already follow me. And if you prefer a more personal touch you can find me @pidgeon_pete@mas.to (a TMNT reference if you need an explanation for the handle).</p>
