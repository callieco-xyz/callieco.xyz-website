      <h2>Bad Painting</h2>
      <p class="date"><small>22 Mar 2025</small></p>
      <p>I recently finished painting a new miniature for my collection, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. The process began with a solid black primer to ensure the details would pop once I started layering on colors. I decided to go for a bold, high-contrast color scheme with a mix of metallic silvers and deep blues for the armor, which gave the miniature a striking look. I used washes to bring out the details and a light dry brushing technique to highlight the raised areas, making the figure feel dynamic and well-defined.</p>

<p>The most satisfying part of painting this miniature was adding the final touches, like the eyes and small accents, which brought it to life. After spending a few hours on it, I was able to get the perfect balance of shadows and highlights. Overall, it was a fun and rewarding project that added a great new piece to my collection. Now, it’s time to get ready for the next miniature, and I’m already brainstorming ideas for another custom color scheme!</p>
